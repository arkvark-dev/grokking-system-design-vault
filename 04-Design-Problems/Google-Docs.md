## Learning goals
- Scope real-time shared editing of a document.
- Name the hard part: concurrent edits, not storage of files.
- Plan presence (cursors) as a separate, lossy channel.

## Study todos
- [ ] Open the matching Educative chapter. Keep this note in your own words.
- [ ] Time a first pass (45–60 min) before you read the course solution.
- [ ] Fill the RESHADED-style checkboxes in this note.
- [ ] Write the path for 'I type a character and my peer sees it'.
- [ ] Contrast operational transform vs CRDT at a one-paragraph level (your words).
- [ ] List the building blocks you reused. Wikilink them.
- [ ] Write 3 trade-offs in the Notes section.
- [ ] Do a 5-minute failure story (one component dies). Update Failure modes.
- [ ] Score the attempt with [[Interview-Rubric]]. Set `status` when done.

## RESHADED-style prompts
Use this as a timed interview script. Write your own answers. Do not paste course text.

### R — Requirements
- [ ] State the product in one sentence.
- [ ] List must-have functions for this interview.
- [ ] List functions you will cut from scope.
- [ ] Ask who the users are and what success looks like.

### E — Estimates
- [ ] Pick DAU, peak QPS, and read/write split.
- [ ] Estimate payload size and storage for 1 year.
- [ ] Estimate bandwidth at the edge and at origin.
- [ ] Say if one machine is enough. If not, say why.

### S — Storage and data
- [ ] List the main objects you must store.
- [ ] Choose online store vs object store vs cache vs queue.
- [ ] State retention and deletion rules.
- [ ] Note what must be durable vs what can be rebuilt.

### H — High-level design
- [ ] Draw clients, gateway, core services, and data stores.
- [ ] Write the read path in 5 steps.
- [ ] Write the write path in 5 steps.
- [ ] Mark async work (queues, workers, CDN).

### A — APIs
- [ ] List 3–6 core API calls.
- [ ] For each call, note input, output, and error cases.
- [ ] Say which calls are sync and which are async.
- [ ] Note auth, idempotency, and pagination where needed.

### D — Data model
- [ ] Sketch tables or documents and primary keys.
- [ ] Choose a shard key. Say why it avoids hotspots.
- [ ] Note indexes for the main queries.
- [ ] State replication and consistency for each store.

### E — Evaluate
- [ ] Name the first bottleneck at 10x load.
- [ ] Check the NFRs you promised.
- [ ] Point to a single point of failure. Fix it.
- [ ] Say what you would measure (SLIs) in production.

### D — Deep dives
- [ ] Pick 1–2 components to design in more detail.
- [ ] State two options and the trade-off you choose.
- [ ] Walk through one failure (node, zone, or dependency).
- [ ] Say how you would evolve the design in v2.

## Problem-specific prompts
- Where is the source of truth: client, session server, or store?
- How do you persist without a disk write on every keystroke?
- What happens if two users edit offline and reconnect?
- How do you authorize sharing without putting ACLs on every op?
